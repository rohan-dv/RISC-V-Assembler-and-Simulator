# RISC-V Assembler and Simulator

This project implements a **RISC-V Assembler and Simulator** using Python.  
The assembler converts RISC-V assembly code into 32-bit binary machine code, and the simulator executes that binary on a virtual RISC-V processor.

The project is intended for **learning computer architecture**, **instruction encoding**, and **CPU simulation**.

## Features

### Assembler
- Converts RISC-V assembly instructions to binary
- Supports labels for branch and jump instructions
- Validates instruction syntax and register names
- Handles two’s complement for signed immediates
- Outputs one 32-bit binary instruction per line

### Simulator
- Executes binary instructions generated by the assembler
- Simulates Program Counter (PC), registers, and memory
- Displays register values after every instruction
- Generates both binary and decimal output files
- Ensures `x0` register is always zero
